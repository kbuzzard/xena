# 2023 Summer Projects

I am once again running summer projects related to the Lean theorem prover. This summer they will be in Lean 4.

In the past many projects have been of the form "choose a theorem and teach it to Lean", and no doubt there will
still be some projects of that form this year. However, for a change, I thought that we could also focus on
group projects this year, and also focus on projects which finish up as something which *other people* can interact
with. There are two kinds of projects which fit the bill: projects which make a *game*, and projects which make
some kind of *interactive text*. 

## Games

The [Natural number game](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/) was written in Lean 3, but is in 
the process of being [ported to Lean 4](https://adam.math.hhu.de/).
Parts of it need extensive rewriting; in particular Proposition world and Function world are going to be removed, and
other new worlds (even/odd world, prime number world) could be added.

There is plenty of potential for other games too. Games like the 
[Complex number game](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/complex-number-game) never made it to the web,
but they could be translated into Lean 4 and then put online. Billy Miao wrote a [filter game](https://github.com/Biiiilly/filter)
as part of his M2R project! This needs to be translated into Lean 4 as well. There are plenty of other games that
one could imagine (perhaps a group theory game going up to Sylow's theorems?)

## Interactive texts

People in the Lean 4 community have been experimenting with 
[interactive web pages](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~patrick.massot/Examples/ContinuousFrom.html) where
proofs can be explored. In Lean 3 we also have Lean/Latex hybrid projects such as the
[Liquid Tensor Experiment](https://leanprover-community.github.io/liquid/).
It might be interesting to see what can be done now. 

One text in particular I'm interested in is Prof Liebeck's book "A concise introduction to pure mathematics". Last year we translated
some of the exercises into Lean 3 (see [here](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/m1fexplained/)). More of the exercises need
to be translated but I'm wondering if we can somehow also make the solutions more interactive.

## Other things

If you do not want to get involved in one of these group activities then you can still do things the "old-fashioned" way, choosing
a project and working on it over the summer.

## Dates

The summer projects run for 8 weeks through July and August. I am away at a conference 10th to 14th July, 
and away on a family holiday 14th-18th August. The last day of the projects will be 25th August; on Thursday 24th
we will have a mini-conference on Discord where students present the stuff they've been working on to the rest of the group.
The general rule is that I will be at Imperial in person in the MLC from 9-5 on Mondays, and on the Xena Project Discord in voice
chat 10-5 on Thursdays during this time, but there are some changes because of my travels. You can get an invite to the Xena
Project Discord via Imperial student hub. 

The first session is Monday 3rd July, I'll be in the MLC from 9 and I'll give an introductory talk at 11 (which I'll
also live stream on the Discord). The full timetable for the summer is on the Xena Project google calendar which you
can view via [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=l26hcfbgvh1ba0i216mf9l0llk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon)
or [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/l26hcfbgvh1ba0i216mf9l0llk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) (iCal format)

Ask on the Discord. There's a `#2023-summer-projects` channel.
