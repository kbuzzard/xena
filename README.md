# Xena

Note: this is not a functioning Lean repository! This is simply a collection
of Lean 3 files written by Kevin Buzzard and his students between 2017 and 2019 as we experimented
with how to teach Lean parts of Imperial College's undergraduate mathematics degree.
Lean 3 is now deprecated and this repo is thus just a historical artefact now.

# About

This is a collection of files written by Kevin Buzzard and some of his
students. Kevin Buzzard is the lecturer for the "M1F" course at Imperial,
which is the standard introduction to proof course which runs at many
UK universities. The official name of the course is "foundations of
analysis" although there are other things in there too.

The M1F course was designed by Martin Liebeck
and it is based on his book "A Concise Introduction to Pure Mathematics",
published by Chapman & Hall.

Current student contributors in alphabetical order:

Ellen Arlt,
Tudor Ciurca,
Chris Hughes,
Kenny Lau,
Amelia Livingston,
Julian Wykowski.

The files are mostly written in a computer language called Lean.
Lean is an automated proof checker. You can find more information about Lean at

Basically, Lean can understand mathematics, and can check that it
doesn't have any mistakes in. Most of the files here are Lean verifications
of various pieces of undergraduate level mathematics.

Initially I had imagined
that this project would turn into a formalisation of chunks of the undergraduate
degree at Imperial College; however Lean's mathematics library mathlib ultimately
turned out to fulfill this role. For more about the Xena project, which is
focussed on teaching mathematicians about formalisation, see
